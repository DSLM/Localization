tc.research_text.GOLEMVOIDMETAL=A creepy companion
tc.research_page.GOLEMVOIDMETAL.1=Your studies of the properties of voidmetal and void crystals have yielded interesting results. <BR/>Via the malleability of voidmetal, the self repairing aspects, the compartment shifting in the essentia reservoir you have devised a way to create a voidmetal helper. The theory is that it will carry its items in shifted compartments in itself.<BR/>You are not sure if you should make these helpers, as it's usually stable golem mind might get affected by the void. 

#Flesh to leather
tc.research_name.FLESHTOLEATHER=From rags to Riches
tc.research_text.FLESHTOLEATHER=Making good use of old stuff

tc.research_page.DECHANTMENTTABLE.2=Yet having this here does not seem to activate the table or have any effect on the item.<BR/>After accidentally laying your sword on the table you found out that the table only invokes its magic when an enchanted item is put on it. Since then you use the table to remove unwanted enchants from your tools and foci. <BR/>However this is an unpredicatable process and it comes with strange side effects.<BR/>You also found out that the book would close itself if all enchantments and the magic sheen was removed.

#Elemental shears

tc.research_page.MASTERRINGONE.1=Your researches into the Primal Master Rings has given you the self regenerating power of the wand cores without the regenerated vis being limited to that wand core.<BR/>Expanding on this knowledge you have found the inspiration to combine these rings into a singular ring that will recharge all wands with all types of vis.<BR/>By using the runic properties of a ring you have found the stabilizing key by which you can merge all the rings into a singular vis gateway by sacrificing some of the runic for stability.
tc.research_page.MASTERRINGONE.2=Unfortunately this was not enough to produce any output of vis of noticable quantities due to the runic contaiment field limiting output. By adding primal charms who disperse vis orbs naturally you found a way to increase the vis output through the runic containment to be somewhat useful to you although the output is irregular.
